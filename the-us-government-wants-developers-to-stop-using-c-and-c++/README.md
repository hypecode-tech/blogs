The report on <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/product-security-bad-practices" title="Product Security Bad Practices" hrefLang="en">Product Security Bad Practices</a> warns software companies and developers about developing new products (critical infrastructure and national softwares) with memory-unsafe programming language like C, C++ etc.

In a nutshell, America's Cyber Defense Agency says that you shouldn't use anymore memory-unsafe programming languages because of some critic potantial attacks.


In 2021, a staggering 67% of zero-day vulnerabilities were tied to memory safety problems. 

This rate actually says a lot of thing to us.

### What are alternatives ?

There are several alternatives on memory-safe programming language. The most important point is that a new alternative can replace an older one. Because memory-unsafe programming languages like C and C++ have almost raw strong on every field of computer science. Also, some companies because of warns about to performance, ecosystem and community support. So they postpone their transform to memory-safe languages. 


#### Safe Memory Alternatives:
- Rust
- Golang
- Ruby
- Kotlin
- Dlang

All of these have automatic garbage collector and preventing memory leak. This makes them very robust.

Especially, Rust is very strict about memory safe and it provides a low-level access on hardware and offer to developer high performance.


### What other developer think about that

Some developers look a positive to new programming language which is a memory-safe. However, others don't want to switch because they spend their years to be master in C or C++ and they built a lot of softwares which are robust and don't contain any memory leak. This means a really experienced programmers or engineers can develop safe softwares with "memory-unsafe programming languages". 

Additionally, Linus Tolvard started an attemp to change some kernel modules of linux from C to Rust.

### Blocks in this way 

In tech market, not only developer also companies concern about switching to new safe-memory programming languages. These are reasons why companies don't switch or they do it slowly:

- Stabilization Problems
- Not enough community support
- Small circle thirth-party libraries
- Developers familiar with new technologies demand higher fees
- Few developers who know memory-safe languages

In summary, if a developer is not yet proficient in writing memory-safe code using memory-unsafe languages, they should consider learning memory-safe programming languages to enhance security and avoid common vulnerabilities.
