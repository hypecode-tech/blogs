<strong>React Native</strong> continues to gain popularity as a framework that makes mobile app development much faster and more efficient. However, like any technology, React Native is evolving and improving over time. Recently, a significant update was introduced to its architecture: Fabric and TurboModules.

In this article, we will take a detailed look at the differences between the old and new architecture, how the new features work, and what advantages they offer to developers.

## Limitations of the Old Architecture

### Old Rendering System
<strong>React Native</strong>’s previous architecture was based on a rendering system that operated on the JavaScript Thread (JS Thread). This required JavaScript to execute sequentially in order to render UI components. However, when JavaScript was blocked during each render process, it could negatively impact user interactions. For example, issues like lag could occur when updating the UI, causing the app to become unresponsive.

### Module Communication and Synchronization
In the old architecture, data exchange between native modules and JavaScript code typically occurred in a synchronous manner. This led to performance problems, especially in large and complex applications. Native modules were loaded slowly, and over time, this caused the app to become unresponsive.

## The Foundations of the New Architecture: Fabric and TurboModules

### Fabric: The New Rendering Engine
Fabric was introduced as the new rendering engine for <strong>React Native</strong>. The main goal of Fabric is to eliminate the slow and blocking nature of the previous rendering engine and provide a faster and more efficient rendering process.

Fabric separates the UI Thread and JavaScript Thread, allowing both processing pipelines to run independently. This results in faster UI render operations and a more responsive app during user interactions.

- Async Rendering: With Fabric, <strong>React Native</strong> can perform asynchronous rendering operations. This provides much faster updates to the user interface and prevents the UI thread from getting blocked.
- Independent Operation of Native Modules and Components: Fabric allows native modules and JavaScript code to work independently when rendering UI components, making performance more efficient.

In summary, Fabric is a technology developed to offer a more fluid and faster user experience.

### TurboModules: Faster and More Efficient Module Management
TurboModules offers a much more efficient structure compared to the synchronous module loading system of the old architecture. In this new system, native modules are loaded asynchronously, meaning that the JavaScript thread doesn’t have to wait for a module to load. This results in faster app performance.

In the old system, the JavaScript thread could get blocked while loading and executing a native module. However, with TurboModules, asynchronous communication between JavaScript code and native modules is enabled, allowing both sides to work in parallel.

- Faster Loading: TurboModules enables faster loading of modules, allowing the app to start faster and quickly execute modules when needed.
- Integration with C and C++ Modules: While the old system primarily used JavaScript-based modules, TurboModules supports lower-level languages like C and C++. This is especially useful for performance-critical applications.

### Benefits of the New Architecture
The new <strong>React Native</strong> architecture significantly improves both the development process and app performance. Here are some key benefits of the new architecture:

- Fast and Responsive Apps: Thanks to Fabric, UI updates are much faster, and the app’s responsiveness is improved, preventing lag during user interactions.
- Reduced Memory Usage: In the old architecture, memory consumption during module loading and rendering processes was quite high. The new architecture significantly reduces memory usage.
- Easy Migration: <strong>React Native</strong> provides easy migration paths for moving existing projects to the new architecture. It’s possible to incrementally integrate new features to improve app performance.

### Comparison of Old and New Architecture

| Feature                            | Old Architecture State               | New Architecture State                |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Rendering Process              | Synchronous, blocking                | Asynchronous, fast, and efficient     |
| Module Communication           | Synchronous, JavaScript waits        | Asynchronous, works independently     |
| Performance                    | Slow, performance drops in large apps| Fast, increased app responsiveness    |
| Memory Usage                   | High memory consumption              | Optimized, lower memory usage        |
| Developer Experience           | More complex                         | Simpler, more efficient development process |

### Transitioning to the New Architecture: What to Keep in Mind?
When transitioning to the new architecture, there are a few important things to consider:

- Gradual Transition: It’s best to gradually integrate new features into existing projects. This prevents compatibility issues with the old architecture.
- Fabric and TurboModules Compatibility: In some projects, these new features may not always be directly usable. It’s important to first check which modules are supported and which features may be incompatible.
- Performance Testing: After integrating the new architecture, it’s crucial to perform performance tests to see how the app is performing. This is important to confirm whether the performance improvements are working as expected.

## Conclusion

<strong>React Native</strong>’s new architecture is revolutionizing the mobile app development process. Fabric and TurboModules make apps run faster, more efficiently, and with lower memory consumption. These improvements not only benefit app developers but also provide a better experience for end users.

With the new architecture, <strong>React Native</strong> becomes a much stronger and more flexible platform. It enables developers to work more efficiently by leveraging these new features in their projects.

If you continue developing mobile apps with <strong>React Native</strong>, you should definitely explore the new architecture and consider integrating it into your projects. This transition will boost your app’s performance and accelerate your development process.
