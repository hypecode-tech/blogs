# Next Conf 2024

**Next Conf 2024** is an important event scheduled for October 24, 2024, eagerly anticipated by the web development community. The main theme of the event will include discussions about the upcoming features of Next.js, as well as the future of the framework and the web development world in general. **Vercel** is expected to present a long-term roadmap to make Next.js faster, more flexible, and developer-friendly. Last year, on October 26, 2023, Next.js 14 was released. This year, it is anticipated that Next.js 15 will be introduced alongside Next Conf.

## Innovations in Next.js 14

Next.js 14 will include many revolutionary new features for modern web development. Here are some significant innovations expected with this version:

- **Server Actions**: Full integration with Server Components is anticipated. This feature will make it easier for developers to manage actions on the server side with less code.

- **TurboPack Improvements**: The TurboPack introduced in Next.js 13 is expected to become more stable and faster. Significant reductions in build times are anticipated.

- **Edge Rendering and Serverless Functions**: Stronger integration with Vercel’s Edge Network structure will help applications become faster and more scalable globally.

- **Revamped Router System**: The new router system is expected to offer faster transitions between pages and a simpler structure.

- **Enhanced Caching**: Advanced caching techniques on both the client and server sides will improve performance, especially for large and data-intensive websites.

## The Future of Next.js: Vercel’s Roadmap and the Future of the Web

At **Next Conf 2024**, not only will the new version be introduced, but also **Vercel** team members and community leaders are expected to deliver significant talks about the future of Next.js and the web development world. Here are some highlighted topics:

- **The Future of Serverless Architecture**: Vercel will continue to promote the adoption of serverless architecture. This aims to reduce costs and increase development speed, especially for large projects.

- **Comprehensive Full-Stack Solutions**: Vercel’s positioning of Next.js as a complete **full-stack solution** will facilitate developers in managing frontend and backend operations through a single framework.

- **The Future of the Web: Performance and Accessibility**: The increasing importance of performance-driven development and accessibility in user experience is expected to be emphasized.

- **Integrations with AI and Machine Learning**: It is anticipated that Vercel will increasingly incorporate artificial intelligence and machine learning integrations in the future.

## Why OpenAI Chose Remix.js

OpenAI decided to migrate the **ChatGPT** interface from Next.js to Remix.js. The main reasons for this decision include:

- **Minimalist Structure**: Remix offers a simpler structure that provides developers with a cleaner and more manageable codebase. This facilitates maintenance and development of the project.

- **Data Management**: Remix provides a stronger and more flexible framework for data management, allowing developers to better control data flow.

- **Performance**: Remix’s approach facilitates faster page loading, thereby enhancing the user experience. This can provide performance advantages, especially in large applications.

## Next.js vs Competitors: Competing with Remix

**Next.js** remains popular in the web development world, continually competing with its major rival, **Remix**. Here are the key points of this competition:

- **Performance**: Next.js’s support for **Edge Rendering** and global networks distinguishes it in terms of performance.

- **Ecosystem and Community**: Next.js benefits from a large community and ongoing support from Vercel.

- **Feature Richness**: Next.js is preferred for more comprehensive projects due to its full-stack solutions and advanced integrations.

## Conclusion

**Next Conf 2024** is poised to bring significant innovations to the web development world and attract attention with Vercel's vision for Next.js and the future of the web. Developments in serverless architecture, edge rendering, and many other areas will give Next.js a competitive edge over its rivals.
